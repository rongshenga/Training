# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Repository Overview

This is a minimal training project repository containing only a single HTML file (`index.html`). The project appears to be in its initial setup phase with no formal build system, package management, or complex directory structure.

## Project Structure

- `index.html` - The only file in the project, appears to be a basic HTML file

## Development Commands

Since this is a minimal HTML-only project without a build system:

- Open `index.html` directly in a web browser for testing
- No build, lint, or test commands are currently configured

## Architecture Notes

This is a single-file HTML project with no framework dependencies, no package management, and no build tooling. The codebase is extremely simple and serves as a starting point for development.

## Communication Policy
